        <p class="sectionTag">BASIC CONCEPT OF EDUCATION </p>
        <p class="sectionsubTag">Education is essentially a process of growth and development
            which goes on throughout life. Education is the modification of behavior. Scope
            of education is as vast as life itself. There is no aspect or dimension of life
            which is not covered under education. In fact, all education is life and all life is education.
            Education holds the key to human progress. Education plays an important role in bringing change.
            The Education Commission (1964-66) has emphasised, ‘Education is the one and the only instrument
            that can be used to bring about a change towards the social and economic betterment of India’.

    <p class="sectionsubTag">Self Awareness– Every action you take must not be based on impulse but thoroughly thought through. If you are self-aware, your actions and inactions will inure to your benefit and contribute to your overall success. This is because you are conscious of your choices. For example, a decision to study or go to a party must be based on your judgment and the overall impact it would have on you.
         Role Model– You need a good role model. Getting the right role model is important to help you reach your academic and personal goals. If you open yourself up to be guided by the right people, you are more likely to get quality advice and inspiration to achieve your goals. If there is anyone you admire, contact them, build a meaningful relationship with them and let them mentor you. Read some thoughts on role modeling here. 
         Make time for play– Yes, this is important. Develop new hobbies, make time for relaxation and play if you need to. This will help you take a break from the ‘serious’ stuff, clear your head and come back stronger and refreshed..</p>
